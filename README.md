# Machine Learning Project: Linear Regression on Olympic Medals 

This project aims to delve into machine learning, specifically focusing on the linear regression algorithm. Linear regression is one of the fundamental algorithms in the realm of machine learning, making it an essential concept to grasp. By building a linear regression model from scratch, including the theory, mathematics, and implementation in Python, this project intends to provide a comprehensive understanding of how linear regression works.

## Overview

Linear regression is widely utilized in various fields for predictive analysis. It establishes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables. In this project, we will:

1. **Cover Theory and Equation**: Understand the theory behind linear regression and the equation used to calculate its coefficients.

2. **Implementation in Python**: Develop a Python script to implement the linear regression equation from scratch.

3. **Calculate R-squared Value**: Evaluate the performance of our regression model by calculating the R-squared value, which indicates how well the regression line fits the data.

## Data Source

For this project, we will be using data from the Olympics to implement our linear regression algorithm. Specifically, we aim to predict the number of medals a country will earn based on the number of athletes it enters into the Olympics.

## Contents

1. **Theory**: Explanation of the theory behind linear regression and the mathematical equation used to calculate coefficients.

2. **Python Implementation**: Step-by-step implementation of the linear regression algorithm in Python.

3. **Data Preparation**: Preprocessing and formatting of the Olympics dataset for model training and evaluation.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Calculation of the R-squared value to assess the performance of our linear regression model.

## Usage

This project can be utilized to gain a deeper understanding of linear regression, machine learning concepts, and Python programming. By following along with the provided code and explanations, users can:

- Learn the theory and mathematics behind linear regression.
- Gain hands-on experience in implementing a machine learning algorithm from scratch.
- Apply the knowledge to real-world datasets for predictive analysis.

## Dependencies

The implementation requires Python and the following libraries:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn (for comparison and validation, not for the implementation from scratch)


## Data

We'll be using data from the Olympics, which was originally on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

## Disclaimer

The dataset used in this project is for educational purposes only. Any insights or predictions derived from the model should be interpreted with caution and may not represent real-world outcomes accurately.
